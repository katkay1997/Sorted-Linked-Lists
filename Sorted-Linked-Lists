I have two lists one for even integers and one for odd integers. I insert the links into the list in such a way that the list is sorted from largest to smallest at all times.

Then I print out the list. Next I two merge the two lists into a single sorted list which should be sorted from largest to smallest. This is done by removing links from the even and odd list and inserting them into the merge sorted list.

Then I print out the merged list. I go through the merged list and remove all of the nodes with odd values. Again print out this list. Finally recycle all of the links.
